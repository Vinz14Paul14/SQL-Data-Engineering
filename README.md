# Data Engineering | SQL Exercise
A research project on employees of a (fictional) corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.
I designed the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. I performed Data Engineering and Data Analysis.
